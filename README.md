### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- :uk: :kr:   My name is Jeannie, and I am a Full Stack Developer from South Korea, currently working in London.  
- :nerd_face:   Right now, I am learning Scala with a focus of functional programming and AKKA.  
- :dolphin:   Apart from coding, I'm human and have interests outside of working! This includes cycling, :dog: studying dog behaviours/welfare, knitting, and catching up with friends.
